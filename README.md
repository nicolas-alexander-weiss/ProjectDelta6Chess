# ProjectDelta6Chess

Part of the Word-1st Conference, initiated by Konstantinos Kalaitzidis, Foothill College

ABSTRACT:

Due to increasing computing power and rising interest in the application of machine learning, especially Deep Learning, success stories of AI seem to appear everywhere. 
Especially in the field of games like Chess and Go, the capabilities of a trained neural networks are so impressive that even masters of these games can learn from their artificial opponents.

Despite this tremendous success of projects like AlphaZero (Chess) and AlphaGo (Go), it is not to be forgotten that the success of these projects also relies on vast amounts of computing power that train the underlying models.

It is, therefore, to be examined through this project by creating an intelligent chess computer whether intelligent software can successfully be developed and trained without access to these resources and in limited time.
