while not converged:
    play game:
        evaluate boards using current state of NN;
    get feedback:
        map boards of game with game outcome;
    incorporate feedback:
        compare NN predictions on the boards with actual outcome;
        optimize NN parameters so predictions match outcome more closely;

        (SGD --> perform only small amount of iterations so feedback is not )
        (            too strongly incorporated                              )
