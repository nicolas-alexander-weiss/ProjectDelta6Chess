- Don't implement complete chess computer from scratch
==> use of chess engine for python

- AI:
    -> Evaluation of moves and not for outputting moves
    -> Engine will generate moves and AI will tell, whether move is good
    -> Choose Move with the highest ranking

- NN:
-- Input - current board
-- Output - binary, whether will lead to victory or not
